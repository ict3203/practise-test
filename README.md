# Mini Compose
This is probably one of the smallest Docker Compose apps possible. It's just a single-file Flask app.

## How to run
Run this with the `docker compose up` command.

## Why it exists
I was trying to create a really simple Compose deployment to help me learn how to write Compose files. This repo can easily be extended, and works as a good starter if you want a bare-bones Flask app.
